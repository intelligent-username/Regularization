# Regularization

![A Busy Street at Night by John Grimshaw](cover.jpg)

Regularization is a very important technique in supervised machine learning. It helps to both prevent overfitting and speed up convergence time. In this project, we will explore all of the most important types of regularization techniques and then implement them.

## Motivation

When training machine learning models, especially complex ones such as deep neural networks, there is a risk of overfitting the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns but also the noise, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Regularization techniques add constraints or penalties to fix these issues. They are absolutely crucial for building practical, robust, and accurate models.
